# Prompts I used in chatGPT (GPT-4) to build the banner

### Initial prompt:

You are OnlineAdGPT: an expert online banner designer and programmer.

I want to create a HTML5 banner that uses the GSAP library for animation. 
- Banner size: 300x250
- Background colour: yellow
- Logo: use Arial Bold font to write the brand name "ImaginAI Labs"
- The banner will have 3 frame that will animate between. 
- Animate each line of text one at a time.
- Please generate short ad copy for the 3 frames. It needs to be about C&A Labs venturing into the world of generative AI with text and image generations.
- the 3rd frame, which is the final frame needs to sell the fact that C&A Labs are offering a unique service. There needs to be a blue call-to-action button which says "Learn More".

---

### Subsequent prompts requesting amends:

can the copy on the last frame be a bit bigger. it also needs to appear one word at a time. and the words need to be stacked on top another, aligned to the center an be distributed vertically equally. consider the space the logo takes too when making the alignement distribution.

---

the animation between the frames i'm seeing the text almost blending with each other when animating. can it animate in and out without the overlap?

---

can you change the logo to this image: logo.png

- the width and height of the logo is 150x16 pixels. 
- the logo needs to be aligned to the top right of the banner, with a padding of about 10px
- make the backround of the whole banner black. and the text yellow.

---

The words on the end frame are all appear to be on the same position overlapping. Could it be distributed vertically? Also on the first two frames can you update it so the text is in the middle of the frame?

---

And make the cta button white with rounded corners. And the text black and bold.

---

The copy in the end frame appears too close to the cta button. Can we reduce the font size a bit and align it so that thereâ€™s equal amount of vertical space between the logo and button.

---

i want to add an image to the backround that scales up very slowly by about 10%.  and this backround image only needs to be there from frame 1 and 2. by frame 3 the backround image fades to just show the black background. the background image is 'bg.png'

---

i need to make some tweaks. Can i change the font for all the text to Raleway from google fonts?

---

actually can i have the frame 1, 2, 3 fonts be Unica One and the CTA font to be Raleway (both fonts are from Google Fonts
